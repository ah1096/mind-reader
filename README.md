# mind-reader
AWESOME INC PROJECT: For this project, we will be implementing state management with JavaScript to create a single page web app that plays a game with the user to read their mind.  The focus is to use state management to progress forward to the next view, backward to the previous view, and reset to the first view on the page.  By default, the app should prompt the user to click through the single-page app and see a new view for every step.  You need to be able to scroll through the numbers to find your symbol (page 5 on the wireframe).  The mind reader also happens to have a fun math gimmick based on the factors of 9. This is not something you need to program, people will do the math in their heads.
